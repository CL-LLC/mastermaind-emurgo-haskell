# EMURGO Academy Haskell Course: Solo Project (Welcome to Mastermind!)

Mastermind: A code-breaking game where one player creates a secret code using 4 colors (these can be repeated) , and the other player attempts to guess the code through a process of deduction. The code-maker provides feedback on each guess, indicating the number of that are the correct color and in the correct position, as well as the number of that are the correct color but in the wrong position.

This repository contains a preconfigured Haskell development environment, allowing you to start coding in Haskell with zero installation using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and a browser-based version of VS Code.

The environment contains a skeleton for a simple Haskell project, designed as a starter for the solo project of EMURGO Academy's Haskell course.

## Create Your Environment

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the link to your new repository and prefix it with "https://gitpod.io/#" in your browser
3. Click `Continue with GitHub` and `Authorize gitpod-io`
4. Wait for the environment to build. This can take a while the first time.
5. Select "VS Code Browser" as your editor.

## How to Play Mastermind

Mastermind is a difficult puzzle game, in which one player tries to guess the code their opponent comes up with. Originally a board game, though with roots in earlier pen-and-paper games, Mastermind is now widely available online and for mobile devices as well.

You can also play Mastermind with paper and pen if you don't have the board game or video game version.
